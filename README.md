# Go Practice Projects

This repository contains my hands-on projects while I'm learning the Go programming language. I'm currently following the official Go tutorials at [golang.org](https://golang.org) to get comfortable with Go syntax, features, and best practices.



1. Make sure you have Go installed:  
   https://golang.org/doc/install

2. Clone the repo:

```
 git clone https://github.com/MaksuCode/go-development.git

```
